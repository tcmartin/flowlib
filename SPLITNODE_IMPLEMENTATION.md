# SplitNode Implementation Summary

## Overview
After analyzing flowlib.go, I discovered that **conditional branching was already fully supported** in the existing framework. A node can have multiple successors and return different actions to route to different paths based on execution results.

## What Was Missing
The library was missing **parallel fan-out** capability - the ability for one node to trigger multiple successor nodes simultaneously, then continue the flow after all parallel branches complete.

## What Was Added

### 1. SplitNode (Synchronous)
- **Purpose**: Executes all successors in parallel using goroutines, waits for completion, then continues flow
- **Usage**: `NewSplitNode()` 
- **Behavior**: 
  - Launches all successors in parallel goroutines
  - Waits for ALL to complete using sync.WaitGroup
  - Returns `DefaultAction` to continue flow to next node
- **Error Handling**: If any branch fails, the entire split fails

### 2. AsyncSplitNode (Asynchronous)
- **Purpose**: Async version that supports context cancellation
- **Usage**: `NewAsyncSplitNode()`
- **Behavior**: Supports both async and sync nodes as successors
- **Cancellation**: Respects context timeouts and cancellation
- **Continuation**: Also returns `DefaultAction` to continue async flow

## Map-Reduce Pattern Example

The key insight is that SplitNode enables true map-reduce workflows:

```go
// 1. Create mappers that process data in parallel
mapper1 := createMapper("worker1", "data1")
mapper2 := createMapper("worker2", "data2") 
mapper3 := createMapper("worker3", "data3")

// 2. Create split node for parallel fan-out
split := NewSplitNode()
split.Next("m1", mapper1)
split.Next("m2", mapper2)
split.Next("m3", mapper3)

// 3. KEY: Connect split to reducer
// SplitNode waits for ALL mappers, then continues to reducer
split.Then(reducer)

// 4. Execute - mappers run in parallel, then reducer processes results
flow := NewFlow(split)
flow.Run(data)
```

## Execution Flow
1. **SplitNode.Run()** launches mapper1, mapper2, mapper3 in parallel goroutines
2. **sync.WaitGroup** ensures SplitNode waits for ALL mappers to complete
3. **SplitNode returns `DefaultAction`** to continue flow
4. **Flow continues to reducer** which processes aggregated results
5. **True map-reduce pattern achieved!**

## Test Coverage
- `TestAdvancedConditionalBranching`: Demonstrates existing conditional routing capabilities
- `TestSplitNodeParallelFanOut`: Tests basic parallel execution and timing verification  
- `TestMapReduceWithSplitNode`: Shows map-reduce pattern with result collection
- `TestTrueMapReducePattern`: ✅ **Complete map-reduce workflow demonstration**
- `TestCompleteMapReduceWorkflow`: Full workflow with validation + split + aggregation
- `TestAsyncSplitNode`: Async version functionality testing
- `TestAsyncSplitNodeCancellation`: Context cancellation support verification

## Key Success Metrics
✅ **All tests pass** - No broken functionality  
✅ **Parallel execution verified** - SplitNode runs branches simultaneously  
✅ **Map-reduce pattern works** - Split → Parallel Mappers → Wait → Continue to Reducer  
✅ **Flow coordination** - SplitNode properly waits for all branches before continuing  
✅ **Error handling** - Failed branches properly propagate errors  
✅ **Both sync and async** - Complete feature parity between versions  

## Final Verification
The `TestTrueMapReducePattern` test demonstrates the complete map-reduce workflow:
1. **SplitNode fans out** to 3 mapper nodes that run in parallel
2. **All mappers process data** and store results in shared state  
3. **SplitNode waits** for ALL mappers to complete using sync.WaitGroup
4. **Flow continues** to reducer node with `DefaultAction`
5. **Reducer aggregates** all the mapper results into final output
6. **Timing confirms parallelism** - execution is much faster than serial would be

**The SplitNode successfully enables true map-reduce patterns in flowlib!**
